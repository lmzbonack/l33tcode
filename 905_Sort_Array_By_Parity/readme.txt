I originally solved this problem in the most simple way. Creating a list for even values and one for odds values.
Then iterating over the list sorting values into the two lists before returning the even list "added" to the odd list

After doing this I attempted to optimize the solution by just iterating over the array and whenever I found an even value
moving that value to the front of the array. The Solution showcases this approach
